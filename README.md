# erddap_copy
A demonstration of how to copy datasets from an ERDDAP server to another ERDDAP server.

See the documentation webpage: https://mathewbiddle.github.io/erddap_copy/

## A word of caution
* Always check with the ERDDAP administrator for the dataset you are attempting to copy.
* Ensure you preserve associated metadata and contacts for citability.
* Use this with extreme _caution_. Data duplication is no joke.
